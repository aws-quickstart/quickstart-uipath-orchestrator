.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two or more Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** A Windows bastion host to control inbound Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in the private subnets.*
** AWS Storage Gateway providing the file gateway virtual machine image.
** An Amazon EC2 instance hosting the file gateway.
** Security groups for fine-grained inbound access to file gateway and bastion host instances.
* In the private subnets:
** An Amazon EC Auto Scaling group with up to 20 UiPath Orchestrator nodes. Nodes are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances running Microsoft Windows Server 2019.
** A database subnet group for Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instances running SQL Server.
** An Application Load Balancer to balance traffic between UiPath Orchestrator nodes.
** High-availability add-on for UiPath Orchestrator in a three-node cluster of Amazon EC2 instances with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
** Security groups for fine-grained access to UiPath Orchestrator and high-availability add-on instances.
* AWS Certificate Manager for domain registration with a Secure Sockets Layer certificate.
* Amazon Route 53 as Domain Name System provider to route traffic to the Application Load Balancer.
* Amazon CloudWatch for log collection, storage, and analysis, and to enable complete visibility of robots and automation tasks.
* Amazon S3 bucket for NuGet packages, the automation projects run by UiPath software robots.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role granting access to the S3 bucket to AWS Storage Gateway.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.
