This Quick Start provides a two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC. To set up the networking and routing infrastructure, you only provide the CIDR block for the VPC that you want to create. However, you can configure instance types and software settings such as license keys, user names, and passwords, as discussed later in this guide.
* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into an existing VPC*. Provisions resources into your existing AWS VPC.
